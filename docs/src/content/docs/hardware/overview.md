PÃ¡draig has a great summary on the hardware [here](https://github.com/padraigfl/twsu-arcade-coder-esp32?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works). This is based off their fantastic work and some extra bits I've found while implementing a Rust library.

| Component                          | Description                                                              |
