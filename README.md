# Rust Arcade Coder

This repo has a work-in-progress Rust library and demos for the Tech Will Save Us Arcade Coder.

For more info on the Arcade Coder, see the [wiki](https://jake-walker.github.io/rs-arcade-coder).

## Limitations

- The buttons and display can't be done async, as drawing to the display affects the button inputs.
